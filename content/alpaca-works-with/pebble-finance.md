## What is Pebble?
[Pebble](https://pebble.finance) is an direct indexing app that integrates with Alpaca. [Pebble](https://pebble.finance) allows you to customize an ETF and implement it right in your Alpaca account so you can have a say in what goes into your investing portfolio and never pay ETF fees again.

## How to Use Pebble with Alpaca?
[Pebble](https://pebble.finance) integrates with Alpaca through Alpaca's standard OAuth integration.
