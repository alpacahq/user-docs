# Community

At Alpaca, we truly believe open source and the community around it can change financial systems and 
how we interact with them. It is our commitment to contribute to the community as much as possible. 
With that in mind, we set up a few initiatives where you can learn from and contribute to the community.

As you get deeper into trading and automation, there are many questions and hurdles that you may face 
while trying things out. We find that our community has been growing rapidly to share what they do with 
each other. Alpaca grows with our community and knowledge is built together.


## Community Slack

[Alpaca’s community Slack](https://alpaca-community.slack.com) has grown to be the go-to place for Alpaca 
users regardless of experience or the stage of where they are in the journey of trading. The community 
consists of both very experienced users and beginners. From questions about basic features and 
API instructions to discussions about how the market works and analysis of algorithms they are 
building, the community Slack is the place where you can chat with other community members with
similar experience as well as those who are already running profitable strategies.

There are multiple community-built channels in the community Slack. Popular channels that you may want to 
subscribe to include:

**#random** - Everyone who joins the community Slack automatically joins here. Jump right in to discussions 
ranging from simple coding questions to specific features that Alpaca offers.

**#announcement** - Everyone automatically joins here. This is a ready-only channel for the community 
members and is a place where you can find feature updates and read official announcements from Alpaca.

**#api** - Technical focused discussions regarding the Alpaca API including issues and findings encountered
by the community.

**#algo-development & #algotrading** - Highly technical channels where members share and 
discuss their code, ask questions, and solicit feedback of their strategies.

**#python** - Python is a popular language for writing trading strategies thanks to Quantopian. Many 
Quantopian users are active in our community Slack and discuss open source resources used to support 
existing Quantopian algorithms.

**#zipline-strategies** - This is another Quantopian influenced channel where members talk about 
compatibility and Quantopian’s open source zipline resources.

## Medium Publication - Automation Generation

[Automation Generation](https://medium.com/automation-generation) has become a publication where community members contribute their experience 
and know-how in a more comprehensive format. There are a number of comprehensive instructions and 
how-to guides such as full code snippets of trading strategies and an infrastructure setup overview 
covering which cloud services to use.

If you want to read more about the market, trading strategies, coding, and other topics discussed in the 
community Slack, Automation Generation offers you many comprehensive posts that should help you along the 
way.
