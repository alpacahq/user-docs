# Community

At Alpaca, we believe that open source and the community around it can change financial systems and how we interact with them. It is our commitment to contribute to the community as much as possible. To start, we have set up a few initiatives where you can learn from and contribute.

As you continue on your journey of automated trading, there are many questions and hurdles that might arise while trying things out. Because of this, we have set up several community spaces for automated traders to gather and share knowledge.

## Alpaca Forum
[Alpaca's community forum](https://forum.alpaca.markets) is recommended venue for Alpaca users to discuss topics ranging from trading, algorithms, programming, market data, etc. The forum is also a place to find up-to-date announcements about Alpaca and its features. The forum is the recommended place for discussion, since it has more advanced indexing and search functionality compared to our other community channels.

There are various topics set up for users to discuss, including:

[**Ask the Community**](https://forum.alpaca.markets/c/questions) - Start here if you have any questions on how to use Alpaca, questions about code, etc.

[**Alpaca - Feature Requests**](https://forum.alpaca.markets/c/alpaca/feature-requests) - This category is for discussion on types of features you’d like to see implemented. What new features would you like to see implemented? What is the use case for this feature? How would it be helpful for you?

**Programming - Questions & Issues** - Users can post questions or issues regarding Alpaca technology and receive help.


## Community Slack

[Alpaca’s community Slack](https://alpaca.markets/slack) has grown to be the go-to place for Alpaca
users regardless of experience or where they are in the journey of trading. The community
consists a variety of users, from experienced traders to beginners and many in-between. The community Slack is the place where community members can chat, ask questions, provide feedback, discuss the market, analyze algorithms and more together.

There are multiple channels that all new users automatically are added to in the community Slack: #announcements, #community, #dev-all, #feedback, #q-and-a, and #trading. 

**#announcement** - Everyone automatically joins here. This is a ready-only channel for the community
members and is a place where you can find feature updates and read official announcements from Alpaca.

**#community** - Everyone automatically joins here. Jump right in to discussions, ask questions, and maybe, make new friends!

**#dev-all** - Everyone automatically joins here. All development languages are welcome here, whether it's Python, Go, JavaScript, or more. Just specify what you're working in and get feedback or chat about your code in this channel.

**##feedback** - Everyone automatically joins here. Provide feedback to the Alpaca team! Whether it's about the logo, login flow, feature requests, or something else, leave a note here. The team really appreciates your time, effort and thoughts. 

**#q-and-a** - Everyone automatically joins here. A dedicated channel for questions. 

**#trading** - Everyone automatically joins here. "Trading" normally refers to live trading in the Alpaca community, but you're more than welcome to join #trading-papertrading or #trading-algo to discuss paper trading or algorithmic trading, respectively.

**Any #project- channels** - Any channels that start with "project" are user-created channels for Alpaca-based projects. You are welcome to create one, too! 

### Slack Integration

## Medium Publication - Automation Generation

[Automation Generation](https://medium.com/automation-generation) has become a publication where community members contribute their experience
and know-how in a more comprehensive format. There are a number of comprehensive instructions and
how-to guides such as full code snippets of trading strategies and an infrastructure setup overview
covering which cloud services to use.

If you want to read more about the market, trading strategies, coding, and other topics discussed in the
community Slack, Automation Generation offers you many comprehensive posts that should help you along the
way.
