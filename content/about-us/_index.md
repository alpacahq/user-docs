## How Alpaca Works

## Why Commission-Free?

At Alpaca, we believe in the power of automation in trading and investing, which is notably different from that of
traditional securities brokers. With this belief, we focused on removing obstacles that would prevent such automation
from happening. Naturally, automation tends to generate a large number of smaller transactions. At a traditional broker,
this might result in an unbearable commission expense that outweighs all other costs. To address that, we
made it a point to offer our users commission-free automated trading. This breathes new life into many
types of strategies, including those that trade frequently or use small order sizes. It also supports
developers and technology-minded individuals in their journey by allowing them to start small and
gradually scale up. Ultimately, our customers' success leads to our success.

## How We Make Money?

Securities brokers traditionally generate revenue in multiple ways including charging trading commissions, marking
up margin lending rates and stock loan, keeping interest on cash deposits, receiving payment for order flow by routing orders to
market makers, and marking up the data feed subscription.

Although we do not charge commissions, Alpaca may generate revenue in some of the same ways as traditional online
brokerages. These include:

* Interest on cash deposits
* Payment for order flow ("PFOF") - Alpaca receives remuneration for routing your orders to
market makers and exchanges. PFOF helps us offset the expense that occurs when clearing and executing our
customers' trades. You can read more about PFOF in our Medium post
[here](https://medium.com/automation-generation/commission-free-trading-is-it-helping-or-hurting-you-dc5fdc22ca6a).

* Margin financing - Alpaca may charge interest for margin loans.
* Stock loan - Alpaca may charge stock loan fees for users who want to borrow stock to short sell.

## Regulated Financial Institution

At the beginning of 2018 Alpaca Securities LLC (Alpaca Securities) became a member of FINRA and registered
with the SEC to provide securities brokerage services. In order for Alpaca Securities to obtain such
membership and registration, we had to go through rigorous paperwork and procedure development. Alpaca
Securities’ brokerage service and operations are led by David Rafteseth, who has decades of experience running brokerage operations at TD Ameritrade and Pension Financial, and supported by John Torola, who is a FINRA veteran and most recently led the compliance team at one of the biggest
robo advisory firms, Wealthfront. The team oversees a brokerage operations team consisting of licensed
professionals who came from such firms as Waddell & Reed, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Axos Clearing, and Raymond James.

## Systems and Technology
We initially started Alpaca in 2015 as a pure technology company building a database solution for unstructured data,
initially visual data and ultimately time-series data. One of our achievements, which continues to be improved on an ongoing basis, is [MarketStore](https://github.com/alpacahq/marketstore), a dedicated open source database written in Go designed
specifically to handle financial markets time series data. This led us to provide our technology to financial
institutions including Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Japan's largest bank. We also managed a deep neural net trading
algorithm service, AlpacaAlgo, that had more than 25,000 deep neural net trading algorithms simultaneously constantly
generating trade signals to the users. This required processing a large volume of time series data efficiently.
Hitoshi (Co-founder & CTO/CPO), who leads Alpaca's technology team, comes from Greenplum (Hitoshi was a lead architect of Greenplum), a parallel distributed database company that is used globally by major financial institutions and their quant desks. With his relevant experience from Greenplum, he leads the effort in building and supporting Alpaca's data intensive system architecture.
