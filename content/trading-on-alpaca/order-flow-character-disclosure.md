You should know that the characteristics of your order flow will determine whether the trade venues we route to, will accept it as “retail” order flow. Generally, retail order flow (described below) will not result in any commissions being charged. Retail order flow allows us, as well as other broker dealers, to offer most of our brokerage services without a charge. If or when your order flow is no longer determined to be retail order flow, we may begin to charge a commission or fee for accepting and routing your orders. This determination is usually made by the trade venues we route orders to and can be made without notice or warning, sometimes in the middle of a trading session. We will do our best to notify you when this happens because your trades may then begin to incur a commission or charge.

There are distinctive benefits to having your order flow characterized as retail order flow. Among those benefits are, retail order flow is given priority for execution, retail sized orders are entitled to the displayed quote, many retail orders are given price improvement, and there are rules that protect retail order flow from predatory trading practices.

It is important to know that if your order flow is not characterized as retail order flow, orders submitted will be classified as “not held” orders and are not covered orders under Reg NMS. If you continue to enter orders after notification by Alpaca that your order flow in not retail order flow, this is considered to be consent to the orders being handled as not held orders.

## Retail order flow characteristics

Generally retail order flow originates from a natural person and is both less than 10,000 shares and $200,000 in notional value. Orders originating from an investor’s algorithm are not automatically disqualified as retail order flow. Many “natural persons” use an algorithm to provide signals, trends, patterns, or other information to determine when and what to buy or sell. A natural extension of that process is to route the order for execution. Some things that might disqualify your order flow as “retail” would include; a high trading frequency, a low percentage of filled orders, a high percentage of cancelled orders, a high number of orders over an extended period of time, splitting large orders into multiple small orders, being registered with a broker dealer, trading as a profession whether full time or part time, and engaging a professional to trade your account, among other things.
