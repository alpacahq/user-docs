# API Documentation

In order to start using Alpaca Web API, you will need to obtain your API key. An API key consists of two strings, 
one called Key ID which always appears in your dashboard, and Secret Key, which appears only once when generating 
it. Make sure you keep both in your hands.

### [Web API v2]({{< relref "/api-documentation/api-v2/_index.md" >}})
