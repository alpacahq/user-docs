The Orders API allows a user to monitor, place and cancel their orders
with Alpaca. Each order has a unique identifier provided by the client.
This client-side unique order ID will be automatically generated by the
system if not provided by the client, and will be returned as part of the
order object along with the rest of the fields described below. Once an
order is placed, it can be queried using the client-side order ID to check
the status. Updates on open orders at Alpaca will also be sent over the
streaming interface, which is the recommended method of maintaining order
state.

For further details on order functionality, please see the [Trading On Alpaca - Orders page]({{< ref path="/trading-on-alpaca/orders" >}}).

Please note that body parameters should be passed using a **JSON encoded body**.
