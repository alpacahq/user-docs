# Historical Data

**Please note that Alpaca Crypto Data is in beta - we welcome any feedback to improve our offering.**

Alpaca provides crypto data from multiple venues and does not route orders to all venues even though it offers data.


## Common behavior

**Base URL**

The Crypto Data API provides historical data through multiple endpoints. These endpoints have the same URL prefix (omitted from now on):

```
https://data.alpaca.markets/v1beta1
```

This URL is the **same for both subscription plans**, there is no limitation 


**Authentication**
The authentication is done the same way as with the [Trading API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/#authentication), simply set the following HTTP headers:

- `APCA-API-KEY-ID`
- `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY`


**Limiting**

Use the `limit` query parameter. The value should be in the range **1 - 10000** (endpoints included) with **1000 being the default** if unspecified.


**Paging**

To support querying long timespans continuously we support paging in our API. If the result you have received contains a `next_page_token` that is **not `null`** there may be more data available in the timeframe you have chosen. Include the token you have received as the `page_token` query parameter for the next request you make while leaving the other parameters unchanged to continue where the previous response left off.


**Ordering**

The results are ordered in ascending order by time.

**Timestamps**

The timestamps for trades, quotes, and bars correspond to when a trade was executed or a quote was generated on the exchange or OTC desk.
