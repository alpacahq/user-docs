The account API serves important information related to an account,
including account status, funds available for trade, funds available for
withdrawal, and various flags relevant to an account's ability to trade.
An account maybe be blocked for just for trades (`trades_blocked` flag) or for both
trades and transfers (`account_blocked` flag) if Alpaca identifies the account to
engaging in any suspicious activity. Also, in accordance with FINRA's pattern day
trading rule, an account may be flagged for pattern day trading
(`pattern_day_trader flag`), which would inhibit an account from placing any
further day-trades. Please note that cryptocurrencies are not eligible assets to be
used as collateral for margin accounts and will require the asset be traded using 
cash only.
