# Get Started With Alpaca

The following is a list of working examples built by Alpaca and the developer community. They can be
immediately used in paper or live trading, and best of all, they're free to use and customize for your own
purposes.

*We want to emphasize that these examples are meant to be instructive and demonstrate some of the possibilities of
the Alpaca platform. They have not been analyzed or tested for profitability. Use in live trading at your own
discretion.*
